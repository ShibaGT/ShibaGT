# 👋 yo! i’m **ShibaGT**  
also known irl as **tai**, professional button clicker, self-diagnosed millionaire, and part-time cheat maker.  
Founder @ **shibagt corp**

### 🎮 i mainly mod Gorilla Tag (yes, the monkey game)
i make things go *boom*, *fly*, *vanish*, and sometimes even *work properly*.  

people usually know me for the **ShibaGT Products**:  
> → **XYZ** - the classic  
> → **Dark** - da best free menu of its time  
> → **Gold** - shiny & first paid edition  
> → **Genesis** - nobody really knows what it does, but it’s cool  
> → **Untitled** - because naming things is hard

### 💻 i speak in a few dialects of computer noise:
- **C#** (my main squeeze)  
- **Python** (the snake one)  
- **Luau** (roblox but fancy)  

---

### 🌐 i occasionally help out in the Gorilla Tag community
fixing stuff, breaking other stuff, and pretending i totally meant to do that.  

---

### 💡 my hobbies include:
- writing spaghetti code that somehow works 🍝  
- spending 2 hours debugging a missing semicolon 😭  
- creating mods that nobody asked for but everyone secretly wanted 🧠

### ✨ motto:
